implemented in various games from Call of Duty to Minecraft. This project is an
implementation of the game in San Andreas Multiplayer.

There are two teams, the hiders and the seekers, at the start of a round there
is only one seeker, he can find and kill hiders to get them on the seeker team.
If all the hiders are killed, seekers win. If one or more hiders stay alive,
hiders will win.
