PropHunt SA:MP gamemode


This was inspired by a Minecraft gamemode I recently played which I found was
also inspired by a Team Fortess 2 mod created by a user named "Darkimmortal".

I haven't played the original on TF2 so this is mostly based on the Minecraft
version (if they differ in any way).

There are two teams, the hiders and the seekers, at the start of a round there
is only one seeker, he can find and kill hiders to get them on the seeker team.
If all the hiders are killed, seekers win. If 1 or more hiders stay alive,
hiders will win.


I encourage people to play around with this gamemode, create new maps or even
different versions of it.



Enjoy, do whatever you want with it, but keep my name on it :)
