# PropHunt SA:MP gamemode

The Prop Hunt game was originally made by DarkImmortal for TF2. This is a remake in SA:MP.

There are two teams, the hiders and the seekers, at the start of a round there is only one seeker, he can find and kill hiders to get them on the seeker team. If all the hiders are killed, seekers win. If 1 or more hiders stay alive, hiders will win.

I encourage people to play around with this gamemode, create new maps or even different versions of it.

Enjoy, do whatever you want with it, but keep my name on it :)
