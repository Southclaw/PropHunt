The Prop Hunt game was originally made by DarkImmortal for TF2. This is a remake
in SA:MP.

There are two teams, the hiders and the seekers, at the start of a round there
is only one seeker, he can find and kill hiders to get them on the seeker team.
If all the hiders are killed, seekers win. If 1 or more hiders stay alive,
hiders will win.
